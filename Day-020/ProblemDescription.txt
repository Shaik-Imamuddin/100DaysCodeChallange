Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) 

e.g.: (Input --> Output)
1 -->  1
2 --> 3 + 5 = 8

Sample Tests:
Input:2
Output:8

Input:4
Output:64

Input:5
Output:125

Input:7
Output:343

Time Complexity:

->all methods except the one using a for loop have a time complexity of O(1). it execute in constant time regardless of the input size

The for loop method has a time complexity of O(n) due to its linear relationship with the input size n.
