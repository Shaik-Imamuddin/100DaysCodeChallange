DESCRIPTION:

This problem is about converting numbers to their binary or hexadecimal representation:

If a number is even, convert it to binary.
If a number is odd, convert it to hex.

Numbers will be positive. The hexadecimal string should be lowercased.


Sample Tests:

Testcase-1:
input:2
output:10

Testcase-2:
input:13
output:d

Testcase-3:
input:12800
Output:11001000000000

Testcase-4:
input:8172381723
Output:1e71ca61b

Testcase-5:

output:0

Time complexity:

In BinEvenHexOdd.py

In summary, the time complexity varies among the approaches:

The first and second approaches have a time complexity of O(log n).
The third approach has a time complexity of O(1).
The fourth approach also has a time complexity of O(1).
