#Mumbling

DESCRIPTION:
This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write program accum:

Examples:
"abcd" -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
"RqaEzty" -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
"cwAt" -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"

The input is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

Sample Tests:

Testcase-1:
input:abcdef
output:A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd-Eeeee-Ffffff

TestCase-2:
input:this
Output:T-Hh-Iii-Ssss

Testcase-3:
input:Happy
output:H-Aa-Ppp-Pppp-Yyyyy

Testcase-4:
input:are you
output:A-Rr-Eee-    -Yyyyy-Oooooo-Uuuuuuu

Time Complexity:

while the first and second approaches have a quadratic time complexity of O(n^2).

The third and fourth approaches have a linear time complexity of O(n), 

where n is the length of the input string.
