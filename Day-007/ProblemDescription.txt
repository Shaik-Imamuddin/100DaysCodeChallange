I'm sure you're familiar with factorials â€“ that is, the product of an integer and all the integers below it.

For example, 5! = 120, as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Your challenge is to write a program that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of input integer. So, if your function receives 120, it should return "5!" (as a string).

Of course, not every number is a factorial of another. In this case, your function would return "None" (as a string).

120 will return "5!"

24 will return "4!"

150 will return "None"

sample tests:
Input:120
Output:5!

Input:84
Output:None

Time complexity:
#In ReverseFactorial.py for all methods the time complexity should be O(log n).
The time complexity of the while loop is logarithmic with respect to the value of num, which can be expressed as O(log num).
