DESCRIPTION:

After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. 
So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. 
The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. 
Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

Time Complexity:

In TransportationOnVacation.py

Both approaches have the same time complexity, O(1), 
because they involve a constant number of arithmetic operations, comparisons, and input reading, regardless of the value of d.
