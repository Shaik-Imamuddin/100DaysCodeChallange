Description
->Write a program, which tells us if a given character is a letter or not.

Sample Tests:

Input:'a'
Output:True

Input:'A'
Output:True

Input:'#'
Output:False

Input:'5'
Output:False

Time Complexity:
#In IsItALetter.py 
Method-2:
The in operator checks if a character is present in the string 'qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKKLZXCVBNM'. Since this string is fixed and small, the time complexity of the in operator is also O(1).

Method-3:
These methods check if the character is uppercase or lowercase, respectively. For a single character, these checks are simple and independent of the length of the input, resulting in a constant time complexity of O(1).


The time complexityis O(1). for all methods when the input is a single character is constant.
