DESCRIPTION:
Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

Example:
h = 0
m = 1
s = 1

result = 61000

Input constraints:

0 <= h <= 23
0 <= m <= 59
0 <= s <= 59

Sample Tests:

Test case-1:
Input:1
2
3
Output:3723000

Test Case-2:
Input:0
34
12
Output:2052000

Test case-3:
Input:0
23
12
Output:1392000

Test case-4:
Input:0
11
1
Output:661000


Time Complexity:
In 
Both approaches have the same time complexity, O(1), 
because they involve a constant number of arithmetic operations and input readings, 
regardless of the actual values provided.
