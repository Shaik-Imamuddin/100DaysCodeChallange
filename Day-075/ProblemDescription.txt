Sentence Smash
Write a program that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and prints the sentence.
You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful,
there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

Time Complexity:

In SentenceSmash.py

The third implementation using string concatenation in a loop has a time complexity of O(n^2),
making it less efficient compared to the other implementations which all have a time complexity of O(n).
The most efficient and straightforward method is the fourth implementation, which uses only the join() method.
