DESCRIPTION:
Write a program that accepts a string and a single character, and prints an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

("Hello", 'o')  =>  1
("Hello", 'l')  =>  2
("", 'z')       =>  0

Notes:
The first argument can be an empty string
In languages with no distinct character data type, the second argument will be a string of length 1

Sample Tests:
Testcase-1:
Input: hello
l
Output:2

Testcase-2:
Input: happy
p
Output:2

Testcase-3:
Input: apple
a
Output:1

Testcase-4:
Input: operator
o
Output:2

Testcase-5:
Input: database
a
Output:3

Time Complexity:
In CountOfLetterInAString.py

All methods have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string
