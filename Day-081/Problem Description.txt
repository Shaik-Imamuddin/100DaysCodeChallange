Problem Description:

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 9^2 is 81 and 1^2 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 7^2 is 49, 6^2 is 36, and 5^2 is 25. (49-36-25)

Happy Coding!

Sample Tests:

Test case-1:
Input:123
Output:149

Test case-2:
Input:821
Output:6441

Test case-3:
Input:999
Output:818181

Test case-4:
Input:456
Output:162536

Time Complexity:

In SquareEveryDigit.py

The first two methods that use string concatenation in the loop have a time complexity of O(n^2)
due to the repeated string concatenation. The other methods that use list comprehensions, map, and join have a time complexity of O(n),
making them more efficient for large inputs.
