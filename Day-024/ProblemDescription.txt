Description:

#RemoveTheMinimum

Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with the lowest index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

Sample Tests:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
output = [2,3,4,5]

Input: [5,3,2,1,4]
output = [5,3,2,4]

Input: [2,2,1,2,1]
output = [2,2,2,1]


Time complexity:

In RemoveTheMinimum.py

First Method:
->Finding the minimum value takes O(n) time, and slicing the list takes O(n) time as well.

Other Methods:
->It still iterates over the list to find the minimum value and then removes it from the list using the remove function, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2).
