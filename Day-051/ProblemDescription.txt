Problem Description

Write a program to remove the lowercase vowels (a, e, i, o, u ) in a given string.

Examples
"hello"     -->  "hll"
"codewars"  -->  "cdwrs"
"goodbye"   -->  "gdby"
"HELLO"     -->  "HELLO"

don't worry about uppercase vowels.

Sample Tests:

Test case-1:
Input:welcome
Output:wlcm

Test case-2:
Input:Happy
Output:Hppy

Test case-3:
Input:CodingTime
Output:CdngTm

Test case-4:
Input:Coffee
Output:Cff


Time Complexity:

In VowelRemover.py

the time complexities for the provided approaches are as follows:

Using replace() in a loop over a fixed list of vowels: O(n)
Using replace() inside a loop over the string: O(n^2)
Using a generator expression with join(): O(n)
Using a loop with string concatenation: O(n^2)

The most efficient methods are the first and third approaches, both with a time complexity of O(n).
