#sum the strings

Description:

Write a program,that takes 2 integers in form of a string as an input,
and outputs the sum (also as a string):

sample tests:
Test case-1:
Input:"4"
"5"
Output:"9"

Test case-2:
Input:"34"
"5"
Output:"39"

Test case-3:
Input:""
""
Output:"0"

Test case-4:
Input:"2"
""
Output:"2"

Test case-5:
Input:"-5"
"3"
Output:"-2"

Time complexity:
in SumOfStrings.py the time complexity should be O(n) for all the methods.
where n is the length of the string.
