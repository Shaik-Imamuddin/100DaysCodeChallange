Write a program, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two Inputs: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

The 2 Inputs: 
	->exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); 
	->projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

This program should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
0, in other cases

Sample Tests:
Input:100
12
Output:100

Input:99
0
Output:100

Input:10
15
Output:100

Input:85
5
Output:90


Input:55
3
Output:75

Input:55
0
Output:0

Input:20
2
Output:0
