Description:
Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).

The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.

Mind the input validation.

Sample test:

Input:5
2
5
3
6
4
Output:[2, 5, 3, 6, 4]
12

Input:2
34
32
Output:[32, 34]
0

Input:4
54
32
76
12
Output:[12, 32, 54, 76]
86

Time Complexity:
In SumWithoutHighestAndLowestNumber.py

->method-1:
This code involves sorting the list using the sorted() method, which has a time complexity of O(nlogn).

->method-2:
This code first constructs the list l by taking input from the user, which takes linear time O(n).
It then calculates the sum, maximum, and minimum of the list, all of which take linear time O(n).
The overall time complexity of this method is O(n).
