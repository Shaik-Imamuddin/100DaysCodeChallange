Description:
Your task is to Write a program that can take any non-negative integer as input and print it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

Sample Tests:

Input: 42145 
Output: 54421

Input: 145263 
Output: 654321

Input:54321
Output:54321

Input: 123456789 
Output: 987654321

Time Complexity:
In DesendingOrder.py

Linearithemic Time

all methods will take the time complexity of O(n log n), which means they execute in Linearithemic Time.

The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation, which has a time complexity of O(nlogn), where n is the number of digits in the input number.
