DESCRIPTION:

Write a Program that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase,
or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards,
such as madam or racecar.

Sample Tests:

Testcase-1:
Input:happy
Output:False

Testcase-2:
Input:oyo
OutputTrue

Testcase-3:
Input:today
Output:False

Testcase-4:
Input:madam
Output:True

Testcase-5:
Input:therefore
Output:False

Time Complexity:

In IsItAPalindrome.py

Using join() Method: O(n)
Using Conditional Statements with upper() Method: O(n)
Using Conditional Statements with lower() Method: O(n)

All methods have the same time complexity of O(n), 
where n is the length of the string.
