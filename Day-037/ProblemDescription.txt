ProblemDescription

Write a program which takes two arguments and returns all numbers which are divisible by the given divisor. 

Sample Tests:

Testcase-1:
Input:Enter Array Length:5
60
66
45
23
41
Output:[60, 66, 45, 23, 41]

TestCase-2:
Input:Enter the Divisor:5
[60, 45]
Enter Array Length:3
12
24
36
[12, 24, 36]
Enter the Divisor:12
Output:[12, 24, 36]

TestCase-3:
Input:Enter Array Length:6
7
89
34
5
12
76
[7, 89, 34, 5, 12, 76]
Enter the Divisor:3
Output:[12]

Time Complexity:

In NumbersWhichAreDivisibleByGivenNumberInAnArray.py

Both methods have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
This is because they both iterate through each element of the input list once to perform the required operations.
