Description:

FindMultiplesOfANumber

In this simple exercise, you will build a program that takes a value, integer , and returns a list of its multiples up to another value, limit . If limit is a multiple of integer, it should be included as well. The input will only positive integers , not consisting of 0. The limit will always be higher than the base.


if my input 2 and 6 then The program will print [2, 4, 6] as 2, 4, and 6 are the multiples of 2 up to 6.

Sample Tests:
Input:10
100
Output:[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]

Input:3
9
Output:[3, 6, 9]


Input:2
12
Output:[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]


Input:5
25
Output:[5, 10, 15, 20, 25]


Input:9
81
Output:[9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81]



Input:7
77
Output:[7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77]


Time Complexity:

In FindMultiplesOfANumber.py

The Time Complexity for all methods is O(n) results the linear Time Complexity.
it should having in the range of one value to another value.the difference will be based on the inputs
so the time complexity should be linear.
