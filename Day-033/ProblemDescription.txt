Your task is to write a program that receive a list of integers as input, and return the Minimum and Maximum number in that list, respectively.

Sample Tests:

TestCase-1:
Input:4
23
12
-2
12
Output:-2 23

TestCase-2:
Input:9
4
6
2
1
9
63
-134
566
12
Output:-134 566

TestCase-3:
Input:1
5
Output:5 5

Time Complexity:

In FindMinAndMaxValueOfAList.py

->Method 1 has a time complexity of O(nlogn) due to sorting, 

->while Methods 2 and 3 have time complexities of O(n) as they iterate through the list once to find the minimum and maximum values. 

->Methods 2 and 3 are more efficient for finding the minimum and maximum values of a list.
