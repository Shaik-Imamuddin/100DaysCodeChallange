DESCRIPTION:

Story
Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. 
Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. 
Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

Task
Write a program that prints both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

Sample Tests:

Testcase-1:
Input:5
34
56
45
56
45
Output:[34, 56, 45, 56, 45]
[34, 56]

Testcase-2:
Input:5
89
90
56
67
23
Output:[89, 90, 56, 67, 23]
[23, 90]

Testcase-3:
Input:4
56
78
89
89
Output:[56, 78, 89, 89]
(56, 89)


Remarks:
All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, 
so you don't need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or a list,
you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.

Time Complexity:

In TheHighestPowerWins.py

By using Conditional Statements Method

Time Complexity: O(n)
Explanation: The loop iterates through each element of the list once to find the minimum and maximum values.
List Indexing with Sorting

By using list indexing and sort() method

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Explanation: The sort() method has a time complexity of O(n log n). Accessing the first and last elements of the list is O(1).
Using min() and max() Functions

By using min() and max() functions

Time Complexity: O(n)
Explanation: Both min() and max() functions iterate through the list once to find the respective values.
