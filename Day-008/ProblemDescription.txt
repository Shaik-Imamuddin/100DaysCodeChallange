###Lucky number
Description:
Write a program to find if a number is lucky or not. If the sum of all digits is 0 or multiple of 9 then the number is lucky.

1892376 => 1+8+9+2+3+7+6 = 36. 36 is divisible by 9, hence number is lucky.

print true for lucky numbers and false for others.

Time complexity: 
#In LuckyNumber.py 
The first and third approaches have a time complexity of O(log n).
The second approach has a time complexity of O(1).

First approach:
The time complexity of this approach depends on the number of digits in the input number, which is proportional to the logarithm of the number itself (base 10).
