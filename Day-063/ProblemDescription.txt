DESCRIPTION:

You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.
If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.


Example(Input1, Input2 --> Output):

6, 10 --> 32
3, 3 --> 9

Note: for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.

Sample Tests:

Testcase-1:
Input:3
3
Output:9

Input:5
8
Output:26

Input:-1
0
Output:-2

Input:-55
55
Output:0

Time Complexity:

In AreaOfParameter.py

All three approaches correctly calculate either the area or the perimeter based on the given conditions,
with each approach having a time complexity of O(1).
