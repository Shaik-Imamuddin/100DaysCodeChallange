Description:
Write a python program to calculate the simple intrest.

Formula ==>  simple interest = (p*t*r)/100

Where p = princeple Amount , r = Rate of intrest , T = Time Period

Sample Testcases:
Testcase-1:
Input:Enter Principal Amount: 50000
Enter Rate of Interest: 4
Enter Time Period in Months: 6
Output:Simple Interest is: 12000.0

Testcase-2:
Input:Enter Principal Amount: 45200
Enter Rate of Interest: 7
Enter Time Period in Months: 80
Output:Simple Interest is: 253120.0

Testcase-3:
Input:Enter Principal Amount: 788880
Enter Rate of Interest: 3
Enter Time Period in Months: 36
Output:Simple Interest is: 851990.4

Testcase-4:
Input:Enter Principal Amount: 320000
Enter Rate of Interest: 10
Enter Time Period in Months: 12
Output:Simple Interest is: 384000.0


Time Complexity:

In SimpleIntrest.py

Both the methods have a time complexity of O(1), 
making them equally efficient in terms of computational complexity.
