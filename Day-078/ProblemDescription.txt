80 <= score < 90		'B'
70 <= score < 80		'C'
60 <= score < 70		'D'
0 <= score < 60			'F'

Tested values are all between 0 and 100. Theres is no need to check for negative values or values greater than 100.

Sample Tests:

Testcase-1:

Time Complexity:
In GradeBook.py

Both methods have a time complexity of O(1),
making them both highly efficient for this task.
