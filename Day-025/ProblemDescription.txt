DESCRIPTION:
Numbers ending with zeros are boring.

They might be fun in your world, but not here.

Get rid of them. Only the ending ones.

sample Tests:

Input:1450
Output:145

Input:960000
Output:96

Input:1050
output:105

Input:-1050
Output:-105

Time Complexity:
In  NoZerosForHeros.py
The time complexity depends on the number of trailing zeros in n.
So it will take Linear Time O(n).
