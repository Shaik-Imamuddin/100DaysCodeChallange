Description:
write a program that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings
returns a new list with the strings filtered out.
it has to return only integers.

sample tests:

input:[1,2,'a','b']
Output:[1,2]

input:[1,'a','b',0,15]
output:[1,0,15]

input:[1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]
Output:[1,2,123]

Time complexity:
#In ListFiltering.py 
All these approaches have linear time complexity O(n) because they require iterating over the entire input list once.
