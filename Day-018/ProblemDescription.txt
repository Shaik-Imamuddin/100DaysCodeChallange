Description:

Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form: shorter+reverse(longer)+shorter.

In other words, the shortest string has to be put as prefix and as suffix of the reverse of the longest.

Strings a and b may be empty, but not null (In C# strings may also be null. Treat them as if they are empty.).
If a and b have the same length treat a as the longer producing b+reverse(a)+b


Sample Tests:

Input:
"first"
"abcde"
Output:"abcdetsrifabcde"
        
Input:
"hello"
"bau"
Output:"bauollehbau"

Input:
"abcde"
"fghi"
Output:"fghiedcbafghi"

Input:"apple"
"ball"
Output:"ballelppaball"

Time Complexity:

The time complexity for all the above methods is O(n), where 

n is the length of the longer string (either a or b). 

This is because the time it takes to reverse a string or join characters depends on the length of the string, which is n.
