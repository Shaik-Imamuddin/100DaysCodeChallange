DESCRIPTION:
You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a program to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the program that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and prints a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

Sample Tests:

Testcase-1:
Input:green
Output:yellow

Testcase-2:
Input:red
Output:green

Testcase-3:
Input:yellow
Output:red


Time Complexity:
In TrafficLight.py

Both methods have a time complexity of O(1),
making them both highly efficient for this task.
