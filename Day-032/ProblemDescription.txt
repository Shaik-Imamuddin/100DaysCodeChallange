DESCRIPTION:
write a program that takes a non-negative integer n as input, and returns a list of all the powers of 2 with the exponent ranging from 0 to n ( inclusive ).

Sample Tests:

input:0  
output:[1]    ->[2^0]

input:1 
Output:[1, 2]    -> [2^0, 2^1]

input:2 
output:[1, 2, 4]  -> [2^0, 2^1, 2^2]

input:3
output:[1, 2, 4, 8]  -> [2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3]


Time Complexity:

In PowersOf2.py

->The time complexity results in linear time it should be O(n) for both of the methods.
