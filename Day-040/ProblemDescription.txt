Description:

Given a number N, can you fabricate the two numbers NE and NO 
such that NE is formed by even digits of N and NO is formed by odd digits of N? 

Examples:

input	NE	NO
126453	264	153
3012	2	31
4628	4628	0

0 is considered as an even number.

Sample Tests: 
input:123456
output:(246, 135)

Testcase-2:
Input:324986
Output:(2486, 39)

Testcase-3:
Input:4268
Output:(4268, 0)

Time complexity:
In EvenAsNEOddAsNoInN.py

all of the provided approaches have a time complexity of O(n),
where n is the number of digits in the input number.
