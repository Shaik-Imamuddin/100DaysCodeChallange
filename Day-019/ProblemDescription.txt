Description:

given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.
If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.
"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

sample tests:

Input:hello
Output:8 5 12 12 15

Input:The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.
Output:20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11

Input:codewars
Output:3 15 4 5 23 1 18 19

Note: The output should return as a string each charecter along with space except last charecter.


Time complexity:
In ReplaceNumberWithAlphabetPosition.py
All three methods have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input text.
