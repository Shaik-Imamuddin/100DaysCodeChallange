DESCRIPTION:
Write a program that returns an array of integers from n to 1 where n>0.

Example : n=5 --> [5,4,3,2,1]

Sample Tests:

Testcase-1:
Input:6
Output:[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Testcase-2:
Input:10
Output:[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Testcase-3:
Input:8
Output:[8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Testcase-4:
Input:4
Output:[4, 3, 2, 1]


Time Complexity:

In ReversedSequence.py

All these methods have a time complexity of O(n) since they involve iterating over the range of numbers from 1 to n.
